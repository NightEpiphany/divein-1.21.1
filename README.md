### NOTE:
1. This is a **server&client** side mod, as it adds **multiplayer animation visibility support**.
2. If animation triggered exceptionally when you do cross-water jump, lower the **trigger sensitivity** in the config file (0-1). Then restart the game and it will work.

- A light weight mod that adds custom animation when player drop into water or lava from a far distance.
- Triggers when player free falling into the fluid source.
- Currently still in dev, bugs may occur. 
- More version support coming soon.
- Recommend using [BetterThirdPerson Mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/better-third-person) & [Effective Mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/effective) for better immersion.
